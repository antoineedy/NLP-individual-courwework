Discuss as a group / decide on the following: 

1. Discuss and gain a collective understanding of the sequence labelling (or token classification) 
task. Ensure you understand the BIO schema of labelling and can understand the segments 
and tags in PLOD-CW dataset provided at the link above. 
 
2. Look at number of instances in each dataset split, viz., train, validation, and test.  
 
3. Discuss if you will use any additional number of training instances as a group and extract 
those instances from the optional dataset (PLOD-Filtered). 
 
4. Plan the experiments, while keeping in mind your resources and time constrains, and explain 
the scope and priorities. 
 
5. Decide on a common development environment (code repository, python libraries needed, 
etc.) and list the choices made. 
 
6. Divide individual tasks and explain how you are planning to work together. Each group 
member could potentially focus on a different experiment setup (i.e., this is part of the 
individual assessment). This might be experimenting with different: 
a. data set preparations (pre-processing and/or featurisation) 
b. algorithms 
c. pre-trained models (transfer learning) 
d. setup of the hyperparameters 
e. any other such relevant experimental variations (if needed)
